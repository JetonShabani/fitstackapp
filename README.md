# FitStack App

This project was made using `React` and `Material UI`. It is a simple fitness app for documenting your workouts and tracking your fitness journey.
It offers the options of creating your own custom workouts and exercises or choosing from a list provided by the app. It also comes with a
neat calender, tracking the days you have exercised and giving you the ability to see your past results to maintain and track your workout routine and progress.
